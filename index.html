  <h1>Welcome to Befriend a Senior</h1>
  <p>This is a youth-led project that helps brings seniors through youth volunteers. The goal is to remind each senior that they are seen, heard, and valued. While also providing a sense of community to our youth volunteers by wellness workshops and fun activities.</p>
